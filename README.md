# Concert Ticket Calculator
This is a simple Java program that calculates and reports on the revenue generated by a concert, given the number of tickets sold and their prices. The program has a user interface that allows the user to enter the number of tickets sold and their prices, and then generates a report based on the input.

## Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Running the program
To run the program, you can use any Java IDE, such as Eclipse, NetBeans, or IntelliJ IDEA. Simply open the project in the IDE, and run the TicketFormClass.java file.

## Using the program
When you run the program, you will see a user interface with several text fields and buttons. To use the program, follow these steps:

- Enter the number of tickets sold and their prices in the corresponding text fields. The program allows you to enter up to three types of tickets, labeled as "Seat A", "Seat B", and "Seat C".
- Once you have entered the ticket information, click the "Create Report" button. The program will generate a report on the revenue generated by the concert based on the input.
- If you want to start over, you can click the "Reset" button to clear the input fields.
- Note that the program validates the user input to ensure that it is in the correct format. The program also disables the "Create Report" button until all the required input fields have been filled in.
